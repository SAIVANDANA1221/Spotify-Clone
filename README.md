# Spotify-Clone

ðŸŽ¶ Just completed an exciting project: building a Music Player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! ðŸŽµ

In this project, I created a fully functional music player with features such as adding, playing, pausing, and seeking songs. It was a fantastic experience to see my skills in web development come to life in this real-world application.
